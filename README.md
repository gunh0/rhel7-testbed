# RHEL (Red Hat Enterpirse Linux) 7 Testbed

To conduct testing on the Red Hat 7 version OS, we have identified the most reliable Docker Hub image available at the following address: https://hub.docker.com/r/openebs/rhel7/tags.

Openebs is an open-source storage platform for Kubernetes. This platform enables the creation of a virtual block storage pool within a Kubernetes cluster, and provides various data management features such as volume lifecycle management, snapshots, and replication.

RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) is an enterprise-grade Linux distribution provided by Red Hat. To run OpenEBS on a Kubernetes cluster, a Linux OS is required, and RHEL is often used due to its high stability and security features. Therefore, testing OpenEBS using RHEL 7 can be a meaningful validation task.
